A production-grade DevSecOps implementation for **WanderLust**, a MERN-stack travel blog application. This project wraps a fully automated CI/CD pipeline around the application, enforcing security at every stage — from code commit to live Kubernetes deployment — with GitOps-driven delivery and real-time observability.

> **Application credit:** The WanderLust MERN application was originally developed by [krishnaacharyaa](https://github.com/krishnaacharyaa/wanderlust). This repository is focused entirely on the DevSecOps engineering layer built on top of it.

## Pipeline Architecture

DevSecOps GitOps Architecture ![DevSecOps+GitOps](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8db20892-a8ee-41eb-81bc-7647cf4bd9b6)


The pipeline is divided into two automated jobs:

**Jenkins CI Job** — triggered on every push to `main`
- Pulls source code from GitHub
- Runs OWASP Dependency Check against all third-party libraries
- Performs SonarQube static analysis and enforces the quality gate
- Executes Trivy filesystem scan
- Builds Docker images and pushes them to DockerHub

**Jenkins CD Job** — triggered automatically after CI passes
- Updates the Docker image tag in the Kubernetes manifests repository
- ArgoCD detects the manifest change and auto-syncs to the EKS cluster
- Prometheus and Grafana provide live cluster monitoring
- Gmail SMTP sends pipeline completion notifications

## Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline

Built on a Jenkins master-worker node architecture. Every commit triggers a run through the complete security and build lifecycle with no manual intervention.

| Stage | What it does |
|---|---|
| Checkout SCM | Pulls latest source from GitHub |
| Workspace Cleanup | Removes stale artifacts from prior builds |
| Install Dependencies | Runs `npm install` for frontend and backend |
| OWASP Dependency Check | Scans third-party libraries against the NVD CVE database |
| Trivy Filesystem Scan | Checks the repository filesystem for vulnerabilities |
| SonarQube Analysis | Static analysis with quality gate enforcement — pipeline aborts on failure |
| Build Docker Images | Builds images for all four services |
| Trivy Image Scan | Scans built container images before any push |
| Docker Push | Pushes verified images to DockerHub |
| Post Actions | Archives build artifacts and sends email notification |

## Docker Hub — Published Images

Both application images are publicly available on Docker Hub at **[hub.docker.com/u/dvanhu](https://hub.docker.com/u/dvanhu)** and are built and pushed automatically by the Jenkins CI pipeline on every successful run.

| Repository | Image | Pull Command |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend | [`dvanhu/wanderlust-frontend`](https://hub.docker.com/r/dvanhu/wanderlust-frontend) | `docker pull dvanhu/wanderlust-frontend` |
| Backend | [`dvanhu/wanderlust-backend`](https://hub.docker.com/r/dvanhu/wanderlust-backend) | `docker pull dvanhu/wanderlust-backend` |

---

## SonarQube — Quality Gate

SonarQube runs against the full codebase on every pipeline execution. The quality gate must pass before any Docker image is built or pushed.

**Latest analysis results:**

| Metric | Result |
|---|---|
| Quality Gate | Passed |
| New Bugs | 0 |
| New Vulnerabilities | 0 |
| New Security Hotspots | 0 |
| New Code Smells | 0 |
| Reliability / Security / Maintainability | A / A / A |

## ArgoCD — GitOps Continuous Deployment

ArgoCD watches the Kubernetes manifests repository and reconciles the live cluster state with the declared state on every commit. No manual `kubectl apply` is ever needed.

**Deployment state:**

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Application Health | Healthy |
| Sync Status | Synced to `main` |
| Auto Sync | Enabled |
| Synced Resources | 10 |
| Healthy Resources | 17 |

<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="Screenshot from 2026-04-06 11-05-03" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e56c45e1-5834-4657-a922-82c59e2c2bdc" />
<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="Screenshot from 2026-04-06 11-05-11" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/99371f94-df87-46dc-a7d5-e9f317e473f6" />


**Deployed resources:**

- `mongo-pv` / `mongo-pvc` — Persistent volume and claim for MongoDB
- `backend-service`, `frontend-service`, `mongo-service`, `redis-service` — Kubernetes Services with EndpointSlices
- `backend-deployment`, `frontend-deployment`, `mongo-deployment`, `redis-deployment` — Deployments, each running 1/1 pods

---

## Monitoring — Prometheus and Grafana

Prometheus scrapes pod-level metrics from the cluster. Grafana surfaces them on the **Kubernetes / Compute Resources / Namespace (Pods)** dashboard with 5-second auto-refresh.

**Live network metrics (5-minute window):**

| Pod | Receive Bandwidth | Transmit Bandwidth | Received Packets |
|---|---|---|---|
| backend-deployment | 87.7 B/s | 39.0 B/s | 398 mp/s |
| mongo-deployment | 23.6 B/s | 69.8 B/s | 280 mp/s |
| redis-deployment | 11.7 B/s | 11.7 B/s | 182 mp/s |
| frontend-deployment | 0 B/s | 0 B/s | 0 p/s |

CPU usage is tracked per pod over a rolling 1-hour window with quota, request, and limit overlays — all pods run well within their declared resource boundaries.

## Key Highlights

- Security gates at every stage — OWASP CVE scanning, Trivy filesystem and image scanning, and SonarQube quality enforcement all run before a single artifact is published
- Zero-touch deployments — ArgoCD reconciles the cluster continuously; updating a manifest tag is all it takes to trigger a full rollout with rollback history intact
- Fully containerized workloads — all four services run as isolated pods on EKS with persistent storage for MongoDB
- Production-grade observability — per-pod CPU, memory, and network bandwidth metrics with configurable alerting via Alertmanager
- Clean separation of CI and CD — the CI pipeline owns build and security; the CD pipeline owns delivery and notification
